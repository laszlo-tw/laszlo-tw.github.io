                        <td>We got Stinkie from a shelter, not a breeder. According to the shelter, Stinkie is an American Shorthair, but we don't think that's the whole story.</td>

(Prior to that, he was a stray.) When Stinkie arrived in the Bay Area, he had already suffered damage to his right eye so severe that it ultimately had to be removed. The shelter veterinarians were unsure of the true cause of the injury, but reported that it was either trauma or infection.</td>
